  <p><span class="h2" style="font-size: medium; font-weith: bold;"><strong>Earth Day</strong></span> is by now a standard tradition in most people’s lives. Having been around for forty-three years, there is an entire generation (or two) for whom the 22nd of April is as much a part of their annual calendar as any other holiday. People turn out in droves to mark the day to appreciate the natural world through acts of service and celebration.</p>
  <p>This year is no exception: Plans are in the works for school and neighborhood cleanups, flower and tree plantings; ground breaking events for new school and community gardens; kids starting seeds in milk-carton containers at school to take home and plant in their own gardens.  Every year Portland Nursery donates and discounts supplies for a variety of Earth Day events.</p>

   <p><span class="h2" style="font-size: medium; font-weith: bold;"><strong>As gardeners,</strong></span> we especially are aware of the need to take care of the environment that feeds us, body and soul. </p>
   <p>And really, every day can be Earth Day – the cumulative effect of small efforts can indeed be great, can indeed make a difference.</p>

  <div id="main" style="margin-top: 750px; clear: both; width: 750px; padding-left: 50px;">
    <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-weith: bold;">Here are some ideas to try for your own celebrating of Earth Day:</h2>
    <ul><li><strong>Start composting your yard debris</strong> – it makes a rich and wonderful soil amendment that you can cycle back into your garden – you can build a composting system or purchase a premade bin of wire or recycled plastic.</li>
<li>Even though we Portlanders can now also recycle our kitchen scraps, it's still fun to have <strong>a worm bin</strong> – makes a great family project, too – it's a sort of garden nerdy thing, but amazing to watch bits of vegetables, fruit peels and egg shells turn into rich material for your soil (or as a great addition to your compost pile). You can purchase a pre-made worm bin or make your own (Zenger Farm has a fun class for making your own worm bin - a fun, <a href="http://www.zengerfarm.org/index.php?page=81" target="_blank">kid-friendly class!</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Disconnect your downspout and install a rain barrel</strong> - your garden will thank you and you'll save some money on your utility bills.</li>
<li><strong>Grow some of your own organic food.</strong> It's better for you, better for the earth.  You don’t need a lot of ground, either; lots of vegetables and herbs grow happily in containers, and some even in shade.</li>
<li>If you have the available space, why not <strong>plant a tree?</strong> (That way, you can celebrate Earth Day and Arbor Day at the same time.) Trees attract birds to your garden; provide shade that helps to cool your house and cut down on need for air-conditioning; and fruit trees have the added benefits of attracting pollinators to your yard and give you tasty fresh produce.</li>
<li><strong>Make room for native plants in your landscape.</strong> Natives need less supplemental water, attract native butterflies and other important pollinators, provide food and shelter for birds. </li>

    </ul><p>And while you're at it, plant a row for the hungry, or just <strong>plant a few extra veggies and take your excess harvest to a local food pantry for those who are food-insecure.</strong> You can contact the Oregon Food Bank to find out the food donation site closest to your garden.</p>
