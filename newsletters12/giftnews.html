<h1>Portland Nursery Staff Gift Choices</h1>
<div class="row1">
<h2>Phalaenopsis: Moth Orchid</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Large, showy sprays of blossoms that last weeks or even months, in a huge range of colors and patterns, what&rsquo;s not to love?  One of the most reliable rebloomers, I&rsquo;ve had varieties that bloom six months a year or more.  AMAZING!&rdquo; -- David</p>
</div>

<div class="row2">
<h2>Itsy Bitsy Tote</h2>
<p>Theyâ€™re perfect as reusable gift bags, lunch sacks, or handbags.  With so many colors and styles of Itsy Bitsies, why limit yourself to just one? -- Christie</p>
</div>

<div class="row3">
<h2>Music of the Spheres: Wind Chimes</h2>
<p>As chimes go they are the best I have ever seen (or heard).  The tones are rich and the pitches very pleasing to the ear.  The different sizes have distinct sounds.  They are also made in the USA!  Take a moment to sound the chimes and I won&rsquo;t have to say anything more about them. -- Sean</p>
</div>

<div class="row4">
<h2>Japanese Pick Mattock</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great weeder!  It&rsquo;s also useful for planting starts and other gardening tasks.  The balance and heft of the tool feels good in your hand.  It has a nice swing to it and can be used repeatedly without strain.&rdquo; -- Brent</p>
</div>

<div class="row5">
<h2>Helleborus x niger &lsquo;Jacob&rsquo;<br />Jacob Christmas Rose</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Historically used for holiday decor in Germany as we use poinsettias.  Pure white flowers bloom Nov-Dec, perfect timing!  Keep it on a porch or indoors where it can be enjoyed, then plant in the ground in spring.&rdquo; -- Laura</p>
</div>

<div class="row6">
<h2>Gainey Bird Feeders</h2>
<p>Available in several striking colors, two sizes, and round or rectangular shapes, ALL Gainey products are hand crafted in the USA with a minimum 25% recycled content and glazes that are 100% free of lead, cadmium, and VOCs.
&ldquo;Modern ceramic design and materials make this a fabulously unique bird feeder.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.  So cool!&rdquo; -- Katie</p>
