  <p><span class="h2" style="font-size: medium; font-weith: bold;"><strong>Forty-two years after it began, Earth Day</strong></span> is still celebrated and is stronger than ever! Plans are in the works for school cleanups and tree plantings; ground breaking events for new school and community gardens; kids starting seeds in milk-carton containers at school to take home and plant in their own gardens; lots of volunteer opportunities for neighborhood cleanup/planting/restoration projects throughout the city.</p>
  <p>Every year we donate and discount supplies for a variety of Earth Day events. This year's recipients include: Oregon College of Arts and Crafts, Hacienda CDC, Richmond Elementary School, Llewellyn Elementary School, Creston Elementary School, Pleasant Valley School, Harrison Park School and Glencoe Elementary School.</p>

   <p><span class="h2" style="font-size: medium; font-weith: bold;"><strong>As gardeners,</strong></span> we especially are aware of the need to take care of the environment that feeds us, body and soul. </p>
   <p>While it has become a cliché that "every day is Earth Day," it can also be true! We can do a little bit, all the time, to make this ground we live on just a little bit better.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-weith: bold;">Here are some ideas to try for your own celebrating of Earth Day:</h2>
    <ul><li>Start composting your yard debris – it makes a rich and wonderful soil amendment that you can cycle back into your garden – you can build a composting system or purchase a premade bin of wire or recycled plastic.</li>
      <li>Even though we Portlanders can now also recycle our kitchen scraps, it's still fun to have a worm bin – makes a great family project, too – it's a sort of garden nerdy thing, but amazing to watch bits of vegetables, fruit peels and egg shells turn into rich material for your soil (or as a great addition to your compost pile).</li>
      <li>Disconnect your downspout and install a rain barrel - your garden will thank you and you'll save some money on your utility bills.</li>
      <li>Grow your own food, organically. It's better for you, better for the earth.</li>
      <li>If you have the available space, why not plant a tree? (That way, you can celebrate Earth Day and Arbor Day at the same time.)  Trees attract birds to your garden; provide shade that helps to cool your house and cut down on need for air-conditioning; and fruit trees have the added benefits of attracting pollinators to your yard and give you tasty fresh produce.</li>
      <li>Make room for native plants in your landscape. Natives need less supplemental water, attract native butterflies and other important pollinators, often provide food and shelter for birds. </li>
    </ul><p>And while you're at it, plant a row for the hungry, or just plant a few extra veggies and take your excess harvest to a local food pantry for those who are food-insecure. You can contact the Oregon Food Bank to find out the food donation site closest to your garden.</p>
