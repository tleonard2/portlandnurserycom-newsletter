    <h1>Winter is heading toward Portland!</h1>
    <p>Here are a few things you can do to protect your garden in winter weather. If you have more questions, you can also phone us at either location or email us at <a href="mailto:info@portlandnursery.com">info@portlandnursery.com</a>.</p>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="268"><img src="../images/nov-weather1.jpg" alt="Portland Nursery" width="258" height="337" /></td>
      <td width="398"><h1>Don't forget to water!</h1>

  <p>Moist roots are much more durable in cold weather than dry roots!  It is easier to take care of your plants before insulating or draining pipes.</p>
  <h1>Prepare for heavy snow or ice    </h1>
  <p>Heavy snow or ice can cause branches on some conifers like Arborvitae and Junipers to bend down under the weight, or to splay. To avoid this problem, tie twine in a spiral shape, like a barber shop pole, around the length of the tree before snows arrive. This will support branches during damaging weather. Twine should be removed in spring when danger of harsh weather passes.</p>
  <h1>Prepare evergreens for winter winds    </h1>
  <p>Cold winds are our biggest foe in winter. Wind desiccates needles and branches, sapping moisture. The hardiest of plants can sustain winter wind damage. Apply <a href="http://www.bonideproducts.com/products/category.php?category_id=8&amp;page=5&amp;per=6">Wilt-Stop</a> to newly planted evergreen plants to help keep leaves and needles moist during drying winter winds.</p></td>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td><h1>Bring tender plants indoors!</h1>
  <p>Bring tender plants indoors – Plants that are in pots and are considered to be tender should be be checked for hitchhiking insects and brought into a cool room of the house, like a garage, for the duration of the most extreme temperatures. Citrus, Cactus, Gardenias, Bougainvillea and tropical Jasmines are all in this category.</p>
  <h1>Plants in Containers</h1>
  <p>    •	Move containers up close the house, preferably in a spot that is protected from cold winds. <br />
    •  Insulate pots. Many products can be used for insulation. Portland Nursery sells frost blankets and burlap for wrapping containers.  Using old sheets or blankets will work fine too, but avoid using plastic to cover plants since moisture and air circulation is important. Adding straw or leaves under frost blankets will increase protection.</p>
  <h1>Fountains</h1>
  <p>Fountains should be drained and the pumps should be unplugged.</p></td>
      <td><img src="../images/nov-weather2.jpg" alt="Portland Nursery" width="255" height="308" class="right" /></td>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../images/nov-weather3.jpg" alt="Portland Nursery" width="255" height="408" class="left" /></td>
      <td><h1>Plants in the Ground!</h1>
  <p>Plants in the Ground – Plants are warmer in the ground than they are in containers. It’s a good idea to increase warmth for anything that is on the border of hardiness by adding mulch and covering plants with frost blanket, burlap or old sheets. Hebes, New Zealand Flax (Phormium), Camellias, Star Jasmine are all in this category.</p>
  <p>We stock frost blankets in 5x50’, 5x25’ as well as 12’ wide in bulk to help protect plants during severe weather conditions. It is permeable and reusable.               Read more...</p>
  <h1>Winter Vegetables </h1>
  <p>Kale, chard, onions, garlic and shallots are fine if left uncovered. Lettuce and other greens, broccoli, cabbages should be harvested or protected with row covers, frost blankets or cold frames.</p>
  <h1>Worm Bins</h1>
  <p>Proud owners of worm bins should protect the worms for winter by bringing bins to an unheated area of the house like the garage.</p>
  <h1>Overwintering</h1>
  <p>With the cold weather starting, it is time to make sure your geraniums, fuchsias and other tender plants are tucked away for winter. For more detailed directions, read our <a href="http://www.portlandnursery.com/plants/docs/overwintering.pdf">Overwintering Tips</a> and visit <a href="http://www.finegardening.com/How-To/Overwintering/74880.aspx?channel=3">Fine Gardening’s website</a> (how to tab, overwintering). </p></td>
