Planting trees, growing our own veggies, connecting with our family and paying attention to our global family is a thread we think most people embrace.</p>

   <p>So really, every day can honor the earth – the cumulative effect of small efforts can indeed be great, can indeed make a difference.</p>

   <div style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;color:#555555;line-height:22px;padding:10px 0 10px 0;"><strong>Here are some ideas you can do in your garden:</strong></div>

<ul style="margin-right: 5px; padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;list-style:none;">
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Start composting your yard debris</strong> – it makes a rich and wonderful soil amendment that you can cycle back into your garden – you can build a composting system or purchase a pre-made bin of wire or recycled plastic.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;">Even though we Portlanders can now also recycle our kitchen scraps, it's still fun to have <strong>a worm bin</strong> – makes a great family project, too – it's a sort of garden nerdy thing, but amazing to watch bits of vegetables, fruit peels and egg shells turn into rich material for your soil (or as a great addition to your compost pile). You can purchase a pre-made worm bin or make your own (Zenger Farm has a fun class for making your own worm bin - a fun, <a href="http://www.zengerfarm.org/index.php?page=81" target="_blank">kid-friendly class!</a>)</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Disconnect your downspout and install a rain barrel</strong> - your garden will thank you and you'll save some money on your utility bills.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Grow some of your own organic food.</strong> It's better for you, better for the earth.  You don’t need a lot of ground, either; lots of vegetables and herbs grow happily in containers, and some even in shade.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Make room for native plants in your landscape.</strong> Natives need less supplemental water, attract native butterflies and other important pollinators, provide food and shelter for birds. </li>
</ul>

<p>And while you're at it, <a href="http://www.oregonfoodbank.org/Give-Food/Plant-a-Row-Program" target="_blank">plant a row for the hungry,</a> or just <strong>plant a few extra veggies and take your excess harvest to a local food pantry for those who are food-insecure.</strong> You can contact the Oregon Food Bank to find out the food donation site closest to your garden.</p>

		<div style="font-family: Georgia,&lsquo;Palatino Linotype&rsquo;, &lsquo;Book Antiqua&rsquo;, Palatino, serif; font-size:28px;color:#555555; text-align:center;padding:30px 0 0 0;">Plant a tree for Arbor Day</div>

<div style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;color:#555555;line-height:22px;padding:10px 0 10px 0; text-align: left;"><p>If you have the available space, why not <strong>plant a tree?</strong> Trees attract birds to your garden; provide shade that helps to cool your house and cut down on need for air-conditioning; and fruit trees have the added benefits of attracting pollinators to your yard and give you tasty fresh produce.</p>

<p>Trees provide privacy, prop up hammocks, protect rivers and streams and house wildlife; not to mention the undeniable beauty of their spring flowers and glowing fall colors.</p>

<p>Trees are versatile as well, with so many sizes and shapes available. Grow a dwarf Japanese maple in a container, shade the house with a majestic Ginkgo, and feature a weeping Crabapple for spring flowers and tiny apples that feed birds in winter.</p>

<p>The modern human community has other, more practical reasons to admire and honor trees. Here is a short list of reasons* trees are necessary for improving our worldly condition.</p>
 <ul style="margin-right: 5px; padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;list-style:none;">
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>1. Trees Produce Oxygen</strong><br />
Let's face it, we could not exist as we do if there were no trees. A mature leafy tree produces as much oxygen in a season as 10 people inhale in a year. What many people don't realize is the forest also acts as a giant filter that cleans the air we breath.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>2. Trees Clean the Soil</strong><br />
The term phytoremediation is a fancy word for the absorption of dangerous chemicals and other pollutants that have entered the soil. Trees can either store harmful pollutants or actually change the pollutant into less harmful forms. Trees filter sewage and farm chemicals, reduce the effects of animal wastes, clean roadside spills and clean water runoff into streams.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>3. Trees Control Noise Pollution</strong><br />
Trees muffle urban noise almost as effectively as stone walls. Trees, planted at strategic points in a neighborhood or around your house, can abate major noises from freeways and airports.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>4. Trees Slow Storm Water Runoff</strong><br />
Flash flooding can be dramatically reduced by a forest or by planting trees. One Colorado blue spruce, either planted or growing wild, can intercept more than 1000 gallons of water annually when fully grown. Underground water-holding aquifers are recharged with this slowing down of water runoff.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>5. Trees Are Carbon Sinks</strong><br />
To produce its food, a tree absorbs and locks away carbon dioxide in the wood, roots and leaves. Carbon dioxide is a global warming suspect. A forest is a carbon storage area or a "sink" that can lock up as much carbon as it produces. This locking-up process "stores" carbon as wood and not as an available "greenhouse" gas.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>6. Trees Clean the Air</strong><br />
Trees help cleanse the air by intercepting airborne particles, reducing heat, and absorbing such pollutants as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Trees remove this air pollution by lowering air temperature, through respiration, and by retaining particulates.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>7. Trees Shade and Cool</strong><br />
Shade resulting in cooling is what a tree is best known for. Shade from trees reduces the need for air conditioning in summer. In winter, trees break the force of winter winds, lowering heating costs. Studies have shown that parts of cities without cooling shade from trees can literally be "heat islands" with temperatures as much as 12 degrees Fahrenheit higher than surrounding areas.</li>
<li style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>8. Trees Act as Windbreaks</strong><br />
During windy and cold seasons, trees located on the windward side act as windbreaks. A windbreak can lower home heating bills up to 30% and have a significant effect on reducing snow drifts. A reduction in wind can also reduce the drying effect on soil and vegetation behind the windbreak and help keep precious topsoil in place.</li>
