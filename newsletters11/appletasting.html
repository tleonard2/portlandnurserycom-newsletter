<h1>It's our 25th Anniversary!</h1>
<p>We can hardly believe this is our 25th Apple Tasting &ndash; to celebrate, <strong>we are inviting our customers to help us name the North American Tree Company apple</strong> that has up to now been known only as NATCO #87! Come in and taste it during the event and give us your best name ideas!  <strong>If your name is selected, you'll win a $100 Portland Nursery Gift Card!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaking of tasting, we will have over fifty varieties of apples and pears to taste (some of them heirloom varieties you are only likely to find at this event), many of them available to buy by the pound at exceptionally low prices.</strong> (If you are just interested in apples and want to avoid the crowds, our Division St. location will have some of the varieties for sale by the pound, too)</p>
<p>Once again we are going to pack these two weekends with lots of great local music and activities for the whole family &ndash; we hope to see you at this fabulous annual free event.</p>
